**Current TODO List**
1. Fix connection between opening and closing trades for trade groups. Currently, the trade group data shows all groups open and they all have their original quantities. 
2. Implement fetching functions to get data out of db
3. Fix special cases for transactions like futures sweep and figure out correct way to deal with options trades (parsing name for info, etc...)
